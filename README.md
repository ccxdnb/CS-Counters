## The test
Create an iOS app for counting things. You'll need to meet high expectations for quality and functionality. It must meet at least the following:

* Add a named counter to a list of counters.
* Increment any of the counters.
* Decrement any of the counters.
* Delete a counter.
* Show a sum of all the counter values.
* Search counters.
* Enable sharing counters.
* Handle batch deletion.
* Persist data back to the server.
* States are important, consider handling each state transition properly.
* Must **not** feel like a learning exercise. Think youâ€™re building this for the App Store.
* Don't build anything that doesn't feel right for iOS.
